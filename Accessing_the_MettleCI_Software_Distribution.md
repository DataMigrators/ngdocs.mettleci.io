# Accessing the MettleCI Software Distribution

There are two ways of acquiring MettleCI. The way you access the
MettleCI software downloads depends upon the basis for your entitlement.

# Licensing directly from Data Migrators

Customers who license MettleCI Download the latest MettleCI Command
Shell distribution package from <a href="http://software.mettleci.io/"
rel="nofollow">http://software.mettleci.io/</a>. Note that customers
will need to register for an account on this site and await approval
before they can download software.

# Acquiring as part of an IBM Cloud Pak for Data entitlement

IBM Clients can leverage MettleCI at no additional cost when trading up,
upgrading, or buying net new licenses of DataStage Enterprise, DataStage
Enterprise Plus, or Information Server for Cloud Pak for Data. Customers
who fall into this category should source their MettleCI software from
their usual IBM channel, which is many cases will be via a Passport
