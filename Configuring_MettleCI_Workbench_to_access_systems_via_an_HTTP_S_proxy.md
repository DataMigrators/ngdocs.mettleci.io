# Configuring MettleCI Workbench to access systems via an HTTP/S proxy

All communication from MettleCI Workbench to other servers over HTTP/S
(e.g., Git and Work Item Management systems), can be configured to use a
proxy by adding the following settings to `config.yml`:

``` java
httpClient:
  proxy:
    host: 192.168.52.11
    port: 8080
    scheme : http
    auth:
      username: secret
      password: stuff
      authScheme: NTLM
      realm: realm
      hostname: host
      domain: WINDOWSDOMAIN
      credentialType: NT
    nonProxyHosts:
      - localhost
      - '192.168.52.*'
      - '*.example.com'
```
