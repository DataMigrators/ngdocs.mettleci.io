## MettleCI Agent Host

MettleCI requires a dedicated physical or virtual server with the
following specification to act as
the <a href="The_Mettle_Agent_Host" data-linked-resource-id="2327019539"
data-linked-resource-version="4"
data-linked-resource-type="page">MettleCI Agent Host</a>:

-   A recent model 8-Core (minimum) Intel-compatible CPU running at
    2.5GHz (minimum)

-   16GB RAM (minimum)

-   250GB (minimum) available high-speed disk, allocated as follows:

    -   100GB for MettleCI components

    -   150GB (estimated) for your assets in Git. Increase this value if
        you believe your Information Server assets will occupy more
        space than this.

-   Microsoft Windows Server 2016\* Base (64-Bit) operating system.

    -   This should be a ‘clean’ operating system which does not contain
        any co-resident third party software or artefacts remaining from
        previous software installations.

    -   It should have the DataStage Client Tools (bundled with your
        Information Server version) installed.  
        Ensure your Windows version is compatible with the DataStage
        Client Tools.  For more information

        rel="nofollow">https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27050442</a>.

-   Provides a mechanism to easy transfer files (e.g. application
    installation files, log files) between the installer's computer and
    this host.

-   This machine should have the CI/CD agent installed which will need
    to be able to communicate with your CI/CD instance (e.g. Jenkins,
    Bamboo, Azure DevOps, etc...).

Note that the MKS Toolkit is no longer installed by default in DataStage
versions 11.7.1.3 or later.

The MKS Toolkit is required by certain MettleCI CLI plugins and should
be installed on the MettleCI Agent Host in order to fully utilise the
capabilities of the MettleCI CLI.

Window Server 2012 is a fall-back option but comes with operating system
restrictions regarding filesystem path lengths that should be discussed
with your MettleCI consultant prior to delivering this infrastructure.
