# MettleCI - Software

# MettleCI Platform Components

The following high-level MettleCI architecture shows the key software
components to be installed, and their communications between hosts. 

# Software

## Customer Software Requirements

The following must be installed or provided on each of the MettleCI
Platform infrastructure components listed below.

### MettleCI Agent Host

-   Customer to install

    -   Current version of Firefox, Chrome or Edge browsers

    -   Notepad++

    -   WinSCP

    -   PuTTY

-   Customer to provide installation media

    -   IBM Information Server Client (GUI and CLI tools) installation
        media. Client version has to be the same as the version (inc.
        patch level) of the DataStage development environment

    -   <u>One</u> of the following Java Development Kits (64-bit
        version 1.8, latest build)

        -   <a href="https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8"
            rel="nofollow">OpenJDK</a>

        -   <a href="index" rel="nofollow">Oracle</a>

### DataStage development Engine Tier

-   Customer to install

    -   <u>One</u> of the following Java Development Kits (64-bit
        version 1.8, latest build)

        -   <a href="https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8"
            rel="nofollow">OpenJDK</a>

        -   <a href="index" rel="nofollow">Oracle</a>

    -   OpenSSL. While Linux-based DataStage hosts usually have this by
        default, Windows-based hosts might not.

## Optional IIS Components

Optionally, the MettleCI Host makes use of the following optional
Information Server components:

-   ***Optional:*** IBM Information Server Operations Console installed,
    configured, and available.  MettleCI uses the Operations Console API
    for authentication, but can be configured to utilise other
    authentication services  if this is not available.  Users are
    required to manually configure their email address in the MettleCI
    Workbench as part of a one-step registration process during their
    first login.  This enables MettleCI to identify their subsequent
    activity in the Git repository.

# Information Server Licenses

-   If you license Information Server under a model that requires
    per-seat licenses please ensure that the following Information
    Server seat licenses are reserved for the Rapid DataStage Upgrade
    MettleCI platform:

    -   Sufficient to cover any MettleCI Consultants involved in the
        installation of MettleCI.

    -   2 x MettleCI Server Service Accounts ('mciworkb' and 'mciagent')
