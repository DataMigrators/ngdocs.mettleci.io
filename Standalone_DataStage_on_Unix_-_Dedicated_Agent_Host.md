# Standalone DataStage on Unix - Dedicated Agent Host

A Unix-based multi-tier DataStage environment whereâ€¦

-   The MettleCI Workstation is installed on your DataStage Engine tier,
    and

-   The MettleCI Agent is installed on a dedicated Windows host

# Notes

-   The Information Server environment can be deployed using a 1-tier,
    2-tier, or 3-tier architecture. Common best practise places the
    Engine tier on a dedicated host, and the Services and Repository
    tiers together on a separate host.

-   The MettleCI Workbench Service runs (in this topology) on a
    Unix-based DataStage Engine tier. This is because this service
    requires a shared filesystem with the MettleCI Unit Test Harness
    which can only be installed on the Engine tier.

-   The MettleCI Agent host is a dedicated host reserved exclusively for
    use by your selected CI/CD build tool via the installed CD/CD agent.
    The MettleCI CLI is used by the CI/CD Agent to automate build and
    deployment activities. The MettleCI CLI and Agent need to be
    installed on a Windows host co-resident with a DataStage Client tier
    in order to enable the automation of the DataStage job compilation
    process, which requires the use of a Windows-based Client tier.
