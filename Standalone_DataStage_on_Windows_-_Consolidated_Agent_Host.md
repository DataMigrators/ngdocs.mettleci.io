# Standalone DataStage on Windows - Consolidated Agent Host

A Windows-only single-tier DataStage environment whereâ€¦

-   The MettleCI Workstation is installed on your DataStage Engine tier,
    and

-   The MettleCI Agent is installed on your DataStage Engine tier.

**This topology may find some applications in POC or Demo environment,
but is <u>not recommended</u> for real-world DataStage development.**

# Notes

-   The Information Server environment (in this topology) has all tiers
    deployed on a single host. **This is not recommended as your
    DataStage Engine will have its licensed capacity reduced by the
    presence of other software components.**

-   The MettleCI Workbench Service runs (in this topology) on the
    Windows-based DataStage Engine tier. This is because this service
    requires a shared filesystem with the MettleCI Unit Test Harness
    which can only be installed on the Engine tier.

-   The MettleCI Agent host also shares the same host, and will have
    actions invoked by your selected CI/CD build tool via the installed
    CD/CD agent. The MettleCI CLI is used by the CI/CD Agent to automate
    build and deployment activities. The MettleCI CLI and Agent need to
    be installed on a Windows host co-resident with a DataStage Client
    tier in order to enable the automation of the DataStage job
    compilation process, which requires the use of a Windows-based
    Client tier.
